# Glowing Sphere of spheres

This is a learning project that I created to teach myself [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/). 

I wanted to created something that loosely reminded the viewer of [this](https://youtu.be/Ddk9ci6geSs?t=126) scene from Iron Man 2. Not a great movie, I know, but great visual.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
